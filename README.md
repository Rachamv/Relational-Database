# Relational-Database

For these courses, I use real developer tools and software including VS Code, PostgreSQL, and the Linux / Unix command line to complete interactive tutorials and build projects.

These courses start off with basic Bash commands. Using the terminal, I learn everything from navigating and manipulating a file system, scripting in Bash, all the way to advanced usage.

Next, how to create and use a relational database with PostgreSQL, a database management system, and SQL, the language of these databases.

Finally, learn Git, the version control system, an essential tool of every developer.

Learn Bash by Building a Boilerplate
The terminal allows you to send text commands to your computer that can manipulate the file system, run programs, automate tasks, and much more.

In this 170-lesson course, you will learn terminal commands by creating a website boilerplate using only the command line.
