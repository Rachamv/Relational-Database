# Relational-Database

For these courses, I use real developer tools and software including VS Code, PostgreSQL, and the Linux / Unix command line to complete interactive tutorials and build projects.

These courses start off with basic Bash commands. Using the terminal, I learn everything from navigating and manipulating a file system, scripting in Bash, all the way to advanced usage.

Next, how to create and use a relational database with PostgreSQL, a database management system, and SQL, the language of these databases.

Finally, learn Git, the version control system, an essential tool of every developer.

## Learn Bash by Building a Boilerplate
The terminal allows you to send text commands to your computer that can manipulate the file system, run programs, automate tasks, and much more.

In this 170-lesson course, you will learn terminal commands by creating a website boilerplate using only the command line.

## Learn Relational Databases by Building a Mario Database
A relational database organizes data into tables that are linked together through relationships.

In this 165-lesson course, you will learn the basics of a relational database by creating a PostgreSQL database filled with video game characters.

## Learn Bash Scripting by Building Five Programs
Bash scripts combine terminal commands and logic into programs that can execute or automate tasks, and much more.

In this 220-lesson course, you will learn more terminal commands and how to use them within Bash scripts by creating five small programs.

## Learn SQL by Building a Student Database: Part 2
SQL join commands are used to combine information from multiple tables in a relational database

In this 140-lesson course, you will complete your student database while diving deeper into SQL commands.

* Build a Student Database: Part 2

## World Cup Database
This is one of the required projects to earn your certification.

For this project, you will create a Bash script that enters information from World Cup games into PostgreSQL, then query the database for useful statistics.
