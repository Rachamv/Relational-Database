The first thing you need to do is start the terminal. Do that by clicking the "hamburger" menu at the top left of the screen, going to the "terminal" section, and clicking "new terminal". Once you open a new one, type echo hello terminal into the terminal and press enter.

What you see in the terminal below is a folder (or directory) on this machine. Type pwd into the terminal and press enter to see the path of the folder. pwd stands for "print working directory".

The output tells you where the folder you are in is located. You are in the project folder, which is in the CodeAlly folder, which is in the home folder. Type ls into the terminal to see what's in this folder. ls stands for "list".

The output is showing everything in this folder. There's two folders here. You can use cd <folder_name> to go into a folder. cd stands for "change directory". Change to the freeCodeCamp directory.

You are in the freecodecamp folder now. You may have noticed that the prompt changed to include it. Print the working directory of the freeCodeCamp folder to see the full path of where you are.

You can see the path of the freeCodeCamp folder. It's in the project folder you were just in. List the contents of the freeCodeCamp folder to see what's here.

There's two folders and three files here. The folders are blue and the files include their extension. Next, change to that test directory.

You can see you are in the test folder now. It shows test in the prompt. Print the full path of this directory. Remember that "folder" and "directory" are the same thing.

That's the path to the test folder, it's in the freeCodeCamp folder. List the contents of this folder.

These are all files. There's no more folders to go into here. You can use cd .. to go back a folder level. The two dots will take you back one level. Go back to the freeCodeCamp folder.

test got removed from the prompt since you left that folder and you're back in the freeCodeCamp folder. List the contents of what's here to remind yourself.

There's the test folder you were just in. You can see what's in a file with more <filename>. Use it to view what's in the package.json file.

It looks like a JSON object. You can empty the terminal with clear. The terminal looks a little cluttered, why don't you clear it.

Now you have a fresh screen 😄 List what's in here again.

You checked out the test folder and the package.json file. What next? Why don't you go into that node_modules directory.

Now the prompt includes node_modules since that's where you are. List what's in the folder.

That's a lot of folders. You can add a flag to a command to use it different ways like this: ls <flag>. List the contents of the node_modules folder in "long list format". Do that by adding the -l flag to the "list" command.

It is showing more details about each item in here and it's a little easier to read. One of the folders is named has, why don't you change into it.

You are now in the has folder. List its contents.

There's a few files and folders here. Can you tell the difference? Take a look at more of that README.md file.

Nothing noteworthy in there. You can't see what's in the here anymore, list the contents again.

That one file doesn't appear to have an extension. Strange. Take a look at more of the that "license" file that doesn't show an extension.

Pretend you read all that. It looks a little messy in here again so why don't you clear the terminal.

Better. Remind yourself what's in here with the list command.

Go into that src directory to see what you can find in there.

View the full path of this folder.

Getting deeper still. You can see that each new folder has a / in front of it. Take a look at what's in this folder.

Only one file here. Show me what's in it with more.

It's some JavaScript 😄 I think you've fooled around enough. Why don't you navigate out of here. Change back to the has directory.

You're getting pretty good. Change back to the node_modules directory.

You can go back two folders with cd ../... Each set of dots represents another folder level. Go back to the project directory from the node_modules directory.

You are back in the project folder where you started. List what's in here again.

That's right. Why don't you get a fresh start by clearing the terminal.

You will be making a website boilerplate. You can make a new folder with mkdir <folder_name>. mkdir stands for "make directory". Make a website directory in this project folder. Remember that "directory" and "folder" mean the same thing.

List what's here to make sure it got created.

It worked. The website files will be in the new directory. Change to the website directory so you can start creating them.

List the contents of the website folder.

It's brand new, there's nothing in it yet. The echo command lets you print anything to the terminal. You used it in the first lesson. Just type what you want to print after it. Use it to print hello website to the terminal.

Websites usually have an index.html file. You can use touch <filename> to create a new file. Create index.html in the website folder.

They usually have a CSS file as well. Create styles.css in the website folder using the same method.

List the contents of the website folder to make sure they got created.

There they are. Next is a JavaScript file. Create index.js in the website folder with the method you have been using.

You might turn this into a git repository. Create .gitignore in the website folder with the same method.

List the contents of the website folder to see your new files.

There's three files, but where's the .gitignore file? I think it's hidden. Most commands have a --help flag to show what the command can do. Display the "help" menu for the ls command. Here's an example: command <flag>

Scroll through the menu to see the flags that go with ls. The flag you are looking for is --all, or -a for short. List all the contents of the website folder using the correct flag.

There's the hidden file. Do you see it? It didn't display before. It also includes . and ... You used cd .. to go back a folder earlier. Change to the . directory.

You didn't go anywhere. The . takes you to the folder you are in, and .. takes you back, or up, a folder. Websites need some images. Create background.jpg in the website folder.

Next, add a header image. Create header.png in the website folder.

Finally, create footer.jpeg in the website folder.

Use the list command to check out the images you just added.

Looks like images show up in pink. There's also three fonts to use for the website. The first one is "roboto". Create roboto.font in the website folder.

The next one is "lato". Create lato.font in the website folder.

Lastly, create menlo.font in the website folder.

List the contents of this folder to see your new font files.

Your three font files are there. There's three icons for the website as well. Create CodeAlly.svg in the website folder.

Next, create CodeRoad.svg in the website folder.

Finally, create freeCodeCamp.svg in the website folder.

Check out the new icons you just added by listing the contents of the folder they are in.

The icons are pink as well. I think the images should go in a separate folder to clean it up a little. Make an images directory in the website folder to put them in.

List the contents of the website folder to make sure your new folder is there.

There's your new images folder. It's blue. You can copy a file with cp <file> <destination>. cp stands for "copy". Copy background.jpg to your images folder.

Better make sure it worked. Change to the images directory.

List the contents to see if background.jpg is here.

There it is. Looks like the copy worked. Change back to the website directory so you can copy the other ones.

Remind yourself of the files here by listing the contents.

You copied the background image to the images folder so you don't need the one here anymore. You can remove a file with rm <filename>. Remove background.jpg from the website folder.

List the contents to make sure it's gone.

Okay, it's gone. Next, copy header.png to the images folder.

Last, copy the "footer" image to the images folder.

All the images should be copied over. Change to the images directory so you can make sure.

Check if the images are here by listing the contents.

They all made it here. Go back to the website folder so you can delete the original files.

List the contents to remind yourself of the filenames to delete.

There's two that you don't need anymore. Remove the "header" image file from the website folder since you copied to the images folder.

It should be gone. Remove the "footer" image from the website folder as well.

List the contents of the website folder to check if they are gone.

Looks like they're all deleted. There was a mistake with the extensions for the font files. You can rename them with mv like this: mv <filename> <new_filename>. mv stands for "move", it can rename or move something. Rename roboto.font to roboto.woff.

Use "list" to check if it worked.

Do you see the "roboto" font? The rename worked. Next, rename the "lato" font file to lato.ttf.

Lastly, rename the "menlo" font to menlo.otf.

Use the "list" command to make sure those last two got renamed.

Take a look at the files to make sure they got renamed. Those font files could be organized into a folder as well. Make a fonts directory in the website folder to put them in.

List the contents of the website folder to make sure your new folder is there.

See it? You renamed the font files with mv, you can also move files with it. Move the "roboto" font to the new fonts folder. Here's an example: mv <file> <destination>.

You can use find to find things or view a file tree. Enter find to view the file tree of the website folder to see all the files and folders withing it.

You can see everything in this website folder and its descendant folders. Notice that they all start with ./ to represent this folder. You can see that your font moved to the fonts folder. Next, move the "lato" font to the fonts folder.

There's one more font to move. Move the "menlo" font to the fonts folder.

Use find again to list the whole file tree and make sure those two got moved.

Yes, you can see them all in the fonts folder. Let's organize some more. Make a client directory in the website folder for the client side files.

You can make a folder in that client folder from here by adding it to the path like this: mkdir client/<new_folder_name>. Make a src directory in the client folder from here.

You can move files all the way across the system from here with the right path. Move index.html to the client/src folder from here.

Use find to view the file tree and make sure it moved.

Can you see the index.html file in your new src folder? Looks like it moved 😄 There's some more files that can go in the src folder. Move index.js to it from here.

Last is the CSS file. Move styles.css to the src folder.

Seems like you can do anything right from here. Take another look at the tree with find.

Things are looking more organized 😄 You can use find <folder_name> to display the tree of a different folder. View the file tree of the client folder from the website folder.

Now you just see what's in the client folder. What else can find do? View the "help" menu of the find command to look around.

The menu isn't very pretty, but there's a -name flag in there. You can use it to search for something with find -name <filename>. Use find with the -name flag to search for index.html.

It shows you where that file is. Using the same command, find where the styles.css file is.

You can search for folders with it, as well. Using the same command and flag, find the src folder.

😄 View the file tree of the website folder to see what else you need to do.

What's next? More organizing! You should put all the assets in one spot. Change into the client folder.

Make a new directory named assets in the client folder.

Change into the new assets folder.

All the images and other assets can go here. Make an images directory in the assets folder for all the images.

Go to your new images folder.

You want the images here. Create background.jpg in this folder.

Wait. You don't need to recreate them. You can just move the other images here. Go back to the website folder from here. It's three folder back.

Now go to where the original images are. Change into the images folder.

List the contents of the images folder to see the files here.

Umm, first I think you should move them back to the website folder. Move header.png back to the website folder. The destination for the file is ..

List the contents of the images folder to see if it's gone.

It's gone. Go back to the website folder.

List what's here.

There's the file you just moved. Next, you will move it to the client/assets/images folder. First, use find with the correct flag to search for images.

There's your two image folders. Move header.png to the one with the longer path. Just use it as the destination to do so.

Use find to search for your header.png file and make sure it moved.

There it is. Right where you put it. Next, search for your footer.jpeg file so you can move that over there.

It's in the original images folder. You can use that path with the move command to move it. Move footer.jpeg to the client/assets/images folder while in the website folder.

View the file tree of this folder to make sure all your images are over in their new folder. Don't use any flags.

You don't need the old images folder anymore. You can use rmdir <directory_name> to remove a folder. rmdir stands for "remove directory". Try to remove the images folder with rmdir. Make sure it's the one in the website folder.

Directory not empty? Oh yeah, there's still the background image in there. Remove the background image file in the images folder from here. Make sure it's the one in the website/images folder.

Try to remove the images folder again with rmdir. Make sure it's the one in the website folder.

I think it worked this time. List the contents to find out.

It worked, the images folder is gone. Make a new icons folder in your assets folder while in the website folder.

Move the CodeAlly.svg file to your new icons folder.

View the file tree of the website folder and make sure it moved.

Verify that the file moved to the icons folder. Next, move the "CodeRoad" file to your icons folder.

Lastly, move the "freeCodeCamp" file to your icons folder.

View the file tree and make sure the files moved.

This looks much better. The three icons are now in the icons folder. Make a fonts folder in your assets folder from here for all the font files.

Turns out you want some different fonts for the website. From here, create roboto-bold.woff in your new fonts folder. You can put the path in front of the filename of where you want it to go.

Next, create roboto-light.woff in your new fonts folder from here.

View the file tree of the client/assets/fonts folder from here to see if your new files are there.

Two more fonts to go. Create lato-bold.ttf in the new fonts folder from here.

Lastly, create lato-light.ttf in your new fonts folder from here.

View your file tree and make sure the files are there.

Things are looking more organized 😄 The new fonts are there. Now you can remove the old fonts folder and everything in it. You can't do that with rmdir since it's not empty. View the "help" menu of the rm command to see if you can find anything.

There's a -r flag that says, remove directories and their contents recursively. That will remove the folder and everything in it. Use the "remove" command with that flag to remove the fonts folder. Make sure it's the one in the website folder. Be careful not to remove the wrong folder.

List what's here to see if it's gone.

Looks like it’s gone. Surely, it went to the trash can right? No, it’s just gone. You should be very careful when recursively removing files like that. It will delete everything, and can destroy your operating system. There's a few more files for the boilerplate. Create package.json in the website folder.

Next, create server.js in the website folder.

Lastly, create README.md in the website folder.

List the content of this folder to make sure your new files are there.

The boilerplate is complete. Use echo to print Yay! to the terminal.

Print I finished the boilerplate! to the terminal.

Print one more thing... to the terminal

You can print to a file instead of the terminal with echo text >> filename. Use it to print I made this boilerplate to your README.md file.

Use more to view your README.md file.

Now that line is in the file. Add from the command line to your README.md file with the echo command and the same method.

Use more to view the "readme" file again.

Now the file has two lines. Add for the freeCodeCamp bash lessons to your "readme" file with the echo command like you did before.

View your "readme" file again like you did before.

😄 Change to the project folder.

You are back where you started. List what's here.

Still the same two folders. Rename the website folder to website-boilerplate.

List the contents of this folder to see the new name.

Thanks for making this. You need to make a copy of it. Take a look at the "help" menu of the "copy" command.

Scroll up to find that "recursive" flag. You need to use it again to copy the whole folder. Copy the whole boilerplate into a folder named toms-website.

List the contents of the project folder to see the new copy.

Thanks. Use find to view the tree of toms-website.

Use find to view the tree of the boilerplate folder to make sure it matches.

Awesome! You are finished for now. Clear the terminal one last time.

Print "goodbye terminal" to the terminal.

Use the "exit" command to exit the terminal.
