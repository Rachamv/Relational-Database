The first thing you need to do is start the terminal. Do that by clicking the "hamburger" menu at the top left of the screen, going to the "terminal" section, and clicking "new terminal". Once you open a new one, type echo hello PostgreSQL into the terminal and press enter.

Your virtual machine comes with PostgreSQL installed. You will use the Psql terminal application to interact with it. Log in by typing psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres into the terminal and pressing enter.

Notice that the prompt changed to let you know that you are now interacting with PostgreSQL. First thing to do is see what databases are here. Type \l into the prompt to list them.

The databases you see are there by default. You can make your own like this:

CREATE DATABASE database_name;
The capitalized words are keywords telling PostgreSQL what to do. The name of the database is the lowercase word. Note that all commands need a semi-colon at the end. Create a new database named first_database.

Use the list shortcut command again to make sure your new database is there.

It worked. Your new database is there. If you don't get a message after entering a command, it means it's incomplete and you likely forgot the semi-colon. You can just add it on the next line and press enter to finish the command. Create another database named second_database.

You should have another new database now. List the databases to make sure.

You can connect to a database by entering \c database_name. You need to connect to add information. Connect to your second_database.

You should see a message that you are connected. Notice that the prompt changed to second_database=>. So the postgres=> prompt before must have meant you were connected to that database. A database is made of tables that hold your data. Enter \d to display the tables.

Looks like there's no tables or relations yet. Similar to how you created a database, you can create a table like this:

CREATE TABLE table_name();
Note that the parenthesis are needed for this one. It will create the table in the database you are connected to. Create a table named first_table in second_database.

View the tables in second_database again with the display command. You should see your new table there with a little meta data about it.

Create another new table in this database. Give it a name of second_table.

There should be two tables in this database now. Display them again to make sure.

You can view more details about a table by adding the table name after the display command like this: \d table_name. View more details about your second_table.

Tables need columns to describe the data in them, yours doesn't have any yet. Here's an example of how to add one:

ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE;
Add a column to second_table named first_column. Give it a data type of INT. INT stands for integer. Don't forget the semi-colon. ðŸ˜„

Looks like it worked. Display the details of second_table again to see if your new column is there.

Your column is there ðŸ˜„ Use ALTER TABLE and ADD COLUMN to add another column to second_table named id that's a type of INT.

Your table should have an id column added. View the details of second_table to make sure.

Add another column to second_table named age. Give it a data type of INT.

Take a look at the details of second_table again.

Those are some good looking columns. You will probably need to know how to remove them. Here's an example:

ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;
Drop your age column.

View the details of second_table to see if it's gone.

It's gone. Use the ALTER TABLE and DROP COLUMN keywords again to drop first_column.

A common data type is VARCHAR. It's a short string of characters. You need to give it a maximum length when using it like this: VARCHAR(30).

Add a new column to second_table, give it a name of name and a data type of VARCHAR(30).

Take a look at the details of second_table to see your columns.

You can see the VARCHAR type there. The 30 means the data in it can be a max of 30 characters. You named that column name, it should have been username. Here's how you can rename a column:

ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME COLUMN column_name TO new_name;
Rename the name column to username.

Take a look at the details of second_table again to see if it got renamed.

It worked. Rows are the actual data in the table. You can add one like this:

INSERT INTO table_name(column_1, column_2) VALUES(value1, value2);
Insert a row into second_table. Give it an id of 1, and a username of Samus. The username column expects a VARCHAR, so you need to put Samus in single quotes like this: 'Samus'.

You should have one row in your table. You can view the data in a table by querying it with the SELECT statement. Here's how it looks:

SELECT columns FROM table_name;
Use a SELECT statement to view all the columns in second_table. Use an asterisk (*) to denote that you want to see all the columns.

There's your one row. Insert another row into second_table. Fill in the id and username columns with the values 2 and 'Mario'.

You should now have two rows in the table. Use SELECT again to view all the columns and rows from second_table.

Insert another row into second_table. Use 3 as the id, and Luigi as the username this time.

You should now have three rows. Use SELECT again to see all the data you entered.

That gives me an idea ðŸ˜ƒ You can make a database of Mario video game characters. You should start from scratch for it. Why don't you delete the record you just entered. Here's an example of how to delete a row:

DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
Remove Luigi from your table. The condition you want to use is username='Luigi'.

Luigi should be gone. Use SELECT again to see all the data and make sure he's not there.

It's gone. You can scrap all this for the new database. Delete Mario from second_table using the same command as before, except make the condition username='Mario' this time.

Only one more row should remain. Delete Samus from second_table.

Use SELECT again to see all the rows in second_table to make sure they're gone.

Looks like they're all gone. Remind yourself what columns you have in second_table by looking at its details.

There's two columns. You won't need either of them for the Mario database. Alter the table second_table and drop the column username.

Next, drop the id column.

Okay, the table has no rows or columns left. View the tables in this database to see what is here.

Still two. You won't need either of those for the new database either. Drop second_table from your database. Here's an example:

DROP TABLE table_name;
Next, drop first_table from the database.

All the tables are gone now, too. View all the databases using the command to list them.

Rename first_database to mario_database. You can rename a database like this:

ALTER DATABASE database_name RENAME TO new_database_name;
List the databases to make sure it got renamed.
